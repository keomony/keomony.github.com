Horray!
Finally the long waiting day has come! I was thrilled and nervous yet ready for the big day of our pre-course.

Got invited to a slack where I could meet other students from the same cohort (November cohort).
Done configuration and installation on my Mac machine from this link http://www.preparetocode.io/. You are guided step by step on what are essential and useful to get everything running for the course.

Done setting up my first blog in Github and made it live!

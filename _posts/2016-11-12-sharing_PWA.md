Progressive Web App (PWA) is the new generation of Web Apps. A few months ago, I had an opportunity to join a very interesting 3-day workshop by Google on PWA. Here is what I have learnt which is for public now [codelab][1].

First thing first, in the page, click on "Your First Progressive Web App". It is about introduction of PWA and how to get things started.
Then you just need to follow the instructions. Have fun and don't forget to share :)

Week 1 is gone! The Terminal City challenge is completed on time! Yeah! A lot more confident with the bash and Git commands :).

Pairing:<br />
But hey, week 2 is even more exciting! I have a friend to study with. We even do the pairing when we try to solve Codewars challenges. Since we have created a comfortable environment, pairing is so much fun for us. It really proves 2 heads is better than 1.

Tutorial books:<br />
At least one of the below books must be completed and pushed to your Github account.
Chris Pine’s Learn to Program - All of it
Ruby Kickstart - At least Chapter 1, 2 and 3
Learn Ruby the Hard Way - At least until chapter 40

I completed “Learn Ruby the Hard Way” and “Learn Ruby In 100 Minutes” while I was preparing for Makers Academy interview. The thing is I didn’t keep my code organised. Some exercises were too easy that I could just use terminal and “rib” to understand how things worked. Since I completed those books, I have started Chris Pine one and I am organising all  my exercises for all the chapters I have covered and pushed them to my Github. From now on, every single thing I do, I must push to Github. So now only Chris Pine folder is net and followed the instructions by the Makers Academy.

Networking/Socialising:<br />
Besides keeping up with the pre-course or I call it “surviving the course”, networking is very important. Going out to meet ups/ events/ workshops/ conferences charges me up! I get to learn from inspiring people who have gone through what I am doing right now. I get to know many useful tips to understand more about Technologies and solving daily problems using Technologies.

Side work: <br />
Since I am writing a blog, I am also learning Markdown. I usually go here to get some tips about Markdown https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#p .

Lessons learnt:<br />
From the next meet up on wards, I will go to someone who is standing/sitting alone and talk to them.
If i feel excluded, by any reason, I will make a move go and join the crowd.

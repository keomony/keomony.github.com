Phew!!! Almost there. The first challenge on command lines and version control is quite fun! Learning and practicing command lines and Git commands while abducting evidences to find the murder is fun.

What if we could control the time the way we cold control code version? We could just “rollback” the time and live the yesterday life again :P

We could make any mistake or something silly (say we stole the real Mona Lisa painting and hanged it on our kitchen’s door) and experienced prison life for sometime before we “checkout” to the time before the mistake and live as if nothing has happened?

Or we could just live a busy life in the busy city like London earning money while in another “branch” we could live in Himalaya and spend our day meditate?

Then we could “merge” those lives or more into one , we would become super man having experiences as much as the universe itself has had :)  

If there’s something I want to change now, it is to express more in words, written words. This blog is the mean to undergo this transition.

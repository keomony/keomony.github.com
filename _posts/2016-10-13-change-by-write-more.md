Phew!!! Almost there. The first challenge on command lines and version control is quite fun! Learning and practicing command lines and Git commands while abducting evidences to find the murder is thrilling fun.

What if you could control the time the way you could control code version? You could just “rollback” the time and live the yesterday life again? :P

You could make any mistake or something silly (say you stole the real Mona Lisa painting and hanged it on you kitchen’s door) and experienced prison life for sometime then you “checkout” to the time before the mistake and live as if nothing has happened?

Or you live a busy life in the busy city such as London earning money while in another “branch” you live in Himalaya and spend the whole day meditate?

Then you could “merge” those lives or more into one , you would become a super man with experiences as many as the universe itself has had :)  

Tip: find this website very helpful about Git http://gitimmersion.com/. I also read about Git and version control in another source but it's only for Makers as it's private.

If there’s something I want to change now, it is to express more in words, written words. This blog is the mean to undergo this transition.
